                I’m a passionate software developer with hands-on experience building practical applications that focus on core logic, system design, and real-time communication. My journey began with curiosity about how software systems work behind the scenes, and it has grown into a strong interest in computer science fundamentals and backend development.
              </p>
              <p>
                I work with C++, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and SQL, developing backend-driven applications and logic-focused projects, including booking and management systems as well as real-time applications using REST APIs, WebSockets, and Socket.IO. My approach emphasizes clean code, problem-solving, and understanding how data, algorithms, and systems interact rather than focusing only on surface-level interfaces.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I’m not coding, I focus on strengthening my computer science foundations, learning new technologies, and improving my understanding of algorithms, databases (SQL and MongoDB), and system-level programming through continuous self-study and hands-on projects.
